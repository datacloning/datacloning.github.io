# Always start with a header

This `Rmd` file demonstrates how we intend to host text/math/code
on the website. We have 3 aims:

1. Folks can read the text/code/math on the web and
  copy/paste for themselves.
  The web design is taken care of GitHub and jekyll pages
  (including Markdown formatting, liquid templating,
  syntax highlight and MathJax notation).
2. The file opens up in [Rstudio](http://rstudio.com), 
  code runs natively in R
  and can be turned into some other format (like `pdf`, `html`, slides, etc.),
  while still properly displaying text formatting, code (with
  syntax highlight), and math (using local MathJax client side rendering).
2. We can delop text/code/math without polluting our workspace
  with ugly html stuff.

# Workflow

1. Create a new `Rmd` ([R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com))file.
2. Use the source of this file (`test.Rmd`) as template,
  espacially as concerns the yaml header. That is the lines between
  the `---` triple dashes. It tells the website how to display
  the content, while it gives directions to the `knitr` R package
  about how to turn the code into html. For different output,
  the `output` tag value can be edited. The only important
  thing really is the `layout`.
 3. Following the syntax rules below.
 4. Save and commit to the `datacloning.github.io` project 
  (or create a pull request). Make sure to push to the
  master branch. Of course, we need to figure out
  placement in the directory tree -- this is under construction.
 5. This way the source code can be edited online as well
  through GitHub. Any changes should be visible on the website
  almost instantly (might have to refresh the browser).

# Showcase

This is plain text.

This text is *italics* and _italics_, while this is
**bold** and __bold__.

For superscript$^2$, use inline math, such as these: $A = \pi*r^{2}$
(written as `$A = \pi*r^{2}$`).

$$ a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2} $$

Test if single dollar sign works: $a^2 = \sum{z}$.\\
Forced new line.

## Table formatting

## Code blocks

Make a code chunk with three back ticks followed
by R (this helps figuring out highlight rules). 
End the chunk with three back ticks: 

```R
paste("Hello", "World!")
``` 

Place code inline with a single back ticks, like
this `paste("Hello", "World!")`.

Few more code blocks:

```
lapply <-
function (X, FUN, ...) 
{
    FUN <- match.fun(FUN)
    if (!is.vector(X) || is.object(X)) 
        X <- as.list(X)
    .Internal(lapply(X, FUN))
}
``` 
and

```R
lapply <-
function (X, FUN, ...) 
{
    FUN <- match.fun(FUN)
    if (!is.vector(X) || is.object(X)) 
        X <- as.list(X)
    .Internal(lapply(X, FUN))
}
``` 
and

```{r}
lapply <-
function (X, FUN, ...) 
{
    FUN <- match.fun(FUN)
    if (!is.vector(X) || is.object(X)) 
        X <- as.list(X)
    .Internal(lapply(X, FUN))
}
``` 

and

{% highlight R startinline %}
lapply <-
function (X, FUN, ...) 
{
    FUN <- match.fun(FUN)
    if (!is.vector(X) || is.object(X)) 
        X <- as.list(X)
    .Internal(lapply(X, FUN))
}
{% endhighlight %}
