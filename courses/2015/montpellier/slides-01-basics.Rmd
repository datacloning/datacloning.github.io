If your ideal slideshow creation workflow contains any of the following steps:

- Just write what's on your mind

- Do some basic styling

- Easily collaborate with others

- Share with and show to everyone

Then remark might be perfect for your next.red[*] slideshow!

# Introduction

```r
a <- 10
*b = a
f <- a
```

<p>Inline math is \(x_i = \sqrt{\frac{a}{c}} \), or eq:</p>
<p>$$x_i = \pi r_{i}^{\Lambda}$$</p>
<p>\[x_i = \pi r_{i}^{\Lambda}\]</p>

Inline math is `$x_i = \sqrt{\frac{a}{c}} $`, or eq:
`$$x_i = \pi r_{i}^{\Lambda}$$`
`$$x_i = \pi r_{i}^{\Lambda}$$`

# Display and Inline

1. This is an inline integral: `\(\int_a^bf(x)dx\)`
2. This is an inline integral, too: `$\int_a^bf(x)dx$`
3. More `\(x={a \over b}\)` formulae.

Display formula:
    `$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$`
